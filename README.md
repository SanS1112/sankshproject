There are 5 Buttons at the top right corner for Adding Row, Saving, ToggleUp, ToggleDown & Delete respectively.

Clicking Adding Button creates a new row & enables inputting new row details. Clicking Save Button will Add the new row with inputted details.

To Delete a particular row, select it by clicking it & then clicking delete icon will delete that particular row.

Clicking Save button is used for 2 things
1. To Add new row (as discussed in 5th Row Above)
2. It also enables deselecting an row, once that row is toggled to desired position in the table.

Toggle Button moves a selected row upwards. Before toggling up  or down, desired row must be selected by clicking on it.
Once the row has been toggled to desired position, clicking save icon will unselect it & modify the table accordingly.

Clicking Table Headers (ChemicalName, Density, Vendor etc)  will order it in descending or ascending order alternatively
